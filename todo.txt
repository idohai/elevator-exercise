1. make elevator (peer?) component who represents 1 elevator in a building.
    then, make this component work. pass a number to a function and make the elevator move to the desired floor.

    breakdown:
        * ElevatorSVG Icon component to be used by the peer. This may be the elevator component iself.
        * Peer component that has x(10) floors and a function to move the elevator in it (transition.)
            this componenet will store:
             - current elevator position
             - current elevator state (isIdle?)
             - function to move the elevator..
             - getter for the floor position


        COpy this element to building or ElevatorSystem
        then:
            - Write logic to find the nearest elevator
            - Call correct peer to send the elevator!
